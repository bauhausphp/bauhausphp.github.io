## Motivation

Bauhaus PHP was idealized by me, aka [fefas](https://blog.fefas.net), as a
response to my dissatisfaction with the existing frameworks in the years
2016-2018. The idea is far way from pretending to be the best framework ever,
instead **the idea is simply to offer the PHP community a different approuch to
design**.

There are many great frameworks and libraries out there with incredable
maintainers behind each of them. Every developer should experiment most of the
available options... PHP is a wide ecosystem.

Anyway, my feeling remains: the way those frameworks were built and have grown
turned out into tools which missteach developers daily. On one hand, when you
open the source, you fall in an endless mess... why so much code for solving
such simple problem? Sometimes it seems even that clean code was never
considered there. On the other hand, you are always struggling to avoid leaking
infrastructure concerns into the core domain. In most cases, you give up because
you don't have the time to find the good solution... indeed you have chosen this
framework to build your application on.

I don't wanna blame any maintainer I mentioned. Putting efforts to the open
source is praiseworthy by itself and this world could be much better if more
developers and companies were concerned to support the community.

The point is: _there is the opportunity to do something new and I wanna get
it..._

## Principles

Here are the basic princicles to be followed:

* Trust contracts (aka interfaces)
* Object oriented coding (
* TDD for designing (let's tests to guide)
* Think on behavior
* Low dependency (less code, better)
* Simplicity (less code, better)

Yes. they have interrelations.

## Facts

* Support only the latest versions of PHP
* Repect PSRs
* Implemented via TDD
